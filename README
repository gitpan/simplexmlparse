# As of v.1.4 it probably handles most XML

# And, although I had tried to 
# get it to work for something like the following:
# <book id="a" title="Gone With The Wind" />
#
# As of v.1.4, the following is still required:
# <book id="a" title="Gone With The Wind"></book> 
# 
# it doesn't appear to do that, yet.
